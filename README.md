# deep
This is supposed to be the framework to create and share information.

A SaaS, using django-rest-framework as the middleware, postgresql for the ORM engine, with celery for asynchronous tasks using redis as the message broker, Deep would be a giant system to teach and share knowledge and information on any concept.

Deep would grow a community, that would make in depth information of concepts accessible to all, and reward each content producer, based on the decisions of the people through the use of Choice Coin algorithm.

- A payment system would be available using Stripe
- Decision making using Choice Coin
- Natural Language Processing to improve the search engine.
